# .net6 Console Application with Dependency Injection
This is a simple Console application to demonstrate a way to use Dependency Injection with it.  
I also made a simple implementation of the Monad pattern.

## Data source
Instead of creating a Database, I used an API themed after the Harry Potter universe. It's a great API with a well documented swagger.
